# A Letter From The Future To Myself
## Written by: Claudia Estupinan Forero

Dear myself,

When you are reading this letter I hope you are fine. Instead, don't worry. I know you cry when you feel
frustrated on the road or desperated because you think you are not good programming, you don't have enough knowledge and people don't appreciate you because you're not brilliant and not fullfill their expetactions. 

You ought to know: 

> "For foolish talk, deaf ears".

Life is a rollercoaster. You have had good moments and bad moments. But every second, every minute is a particle how to learn something new. People live situations and humanbeings have the faculty to figure out our problems. Think about that ex co-worker who cheered you up in the way that you had taken at this time. She said to you must see the glass half full ever. 

If you feel stucked, take your time unless your boss says to you don't have it. Time to walk away, cope with your stress, organize your ideas. Write down in a paper. Set your goal. Divide it in small goals. Stick with it. Try and fail. Trying and failing you can learn more because that experiences stay in your mind. Be more optimistic than pessimistic. This is the road of success. 

If you don't know about a tech topic, Google it, go to local tech meetups, take small tutorials, build your own small projects, ask to someone else, work in group. Practice, practice is the key. You learn failing, you learn new tricks, you solve problems, you lose your fears, you have more confidence and confidence is one virtue to be successful. 

I know that your fulfilling dream is to be a senior web developer one day. But you ought to know you have to tackle your unsexy skills like testing although you hate it. Get feedback all the time because technology changes constantly. Go beyond, research, give speech in community meetups. Check and fix that gap holes. Specialize in one thing. Help others. Contribute with global projects. And the most important, think to be humble instead to show off as the know-it-all, because all people deserve an opportunity. 

The secret to be successful in tech industry is to be an eternal learner. So, don't worry, be happy and go ahead! 

With love,

Myself from the future
